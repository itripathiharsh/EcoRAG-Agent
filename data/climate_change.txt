Climate Change Fundamentals

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While these shifts can be natural, human activities have been the main driver of climate change since the 1800s.

Primary Causes:

1. BURNING FOSSIL FUELS
- Coal, oil, and gas combustion for energy
- Transportation sector emissions
- Industrial processes and manufacturing
- Power generation from non-renewable sources

2. DEFORESTATION
- Reduces nature's capacity to absorb CO2
- Releases stored carbon into atmosphere
- Impacts local weather patterns
- Reduces biodiversity

3. AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
- Livestock methane emissions
- Fertilizer use releasing nitrous oxide
- Land use changes
- Soil degradation

4. INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES
- Cement production
- Chemical manufacturing
- Refrigeration and air conditioning
- Waste management

Key Impacts:

ENVIRONMENTAL
- Rising global temperatures
- Sea level rise and coastal erosion
- Melting glaciers and ice caps
- Ocean acidification
- Changes in precipitation patterns
- More frequent and intense extreme weather events

ECOLOGICAL
- Loss of biodiversity
- Species migration and extinction
- Coral reef bleaching
- Ecosystem disruption
- Changes in growing seasons

HUMAN SOCIETY
- Threats to food security
- Water scarcity issues
- Health impacts from heat and disease
- Economic losses from disasters
- Climate migration and displacement
- Infrastructure damage
