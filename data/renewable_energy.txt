Renewable Energy Overview

Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions.

Main Types of Renewable Energy:

1. SOLAR ENERGY
- Converts sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic panels
- Can be deployed at utility-scale or distributed on rooftops
- Costs have decreased by over 85% in the past decade
- Works best in sunny regions but effective in most climates

2. WIND ENERGY
- Uses wind turbines to generate electricity
- Onshore and offshore wind farms
- Among the cheapest energy sources in many regions
- Can be combined with solar for consistent output

3. HYDROPOWER
- Generates electricity from flowing water
- Includes dams, run-of-river, and pumped storage
- Provides reliable baseload power
- Long operational lifespan

4. GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
- Uses heat from the Earth's interior
- Available 24/7 regardless of weather
- Low emissions and small land footprint
- Limited to geologically active areas

5. BIOMASS ENERGY
- Converts organic material into energy
- Includes wood, agricultural waste, and biofuels
- Can provide heating, electricity, and transportation fuel
- Must be sustainably managed to be carbon-neutral
